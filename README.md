# Dr-Angela-Yu-100-Days-of-Python

Rock Paper Scissors Game
  - I used random module with random.choice() function to get random move from computer
  - I used input prompt to get user's answer
  - If statements for conditions

Get Average Height
  - (NOT ALLOWED TO USE len() and sum() function for this project)
  - Used input prompt to get the value of heights of every student
  - Used the split() method to convert it to a list
  - Set up a counter variable to 0
  - Set up sum of height variable to 0
  - Created a for loop for each height in the list
  - Used arithmetic operations += to add height of every student in the loop
  - Used arithmetic operation to  increment counter for every student
  - Divided the sum of heights to the number of students and rounding it off to the nearest whole number
