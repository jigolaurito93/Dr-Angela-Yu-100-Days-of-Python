# Instructions
# You are going to write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game.

# Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.

# When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".

# When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".`

#   And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"

#Write your code below this row ðŸ‘‡

# create a for loop with a range() function
# The range has to include the numbers from 1 to 100
# create an if statement

for i in range(1,101):
    if i % 5 == 0 and i % 3 == 0:
        print(f"FizzBuzz")
    elif i % 3 == 0:
        print(f"Fizz")
    elif i % 5 == 0:
        print(f"Buzz")
    else:
        print(i)
